# opencv_hand_detection
This project leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe to identify and track hand gestures in real-time through a webcam. The application is designed to detect and distinguish between the left and right hands, enabling intuitive control mechanisms for various functionalities, such as adjusting laptop volume and screen brightness using simple hand movements.
