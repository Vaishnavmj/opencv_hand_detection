# opencv_hand_detection
This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to identify and differentiate between left and right hands in real-time using a webcam feed. By analyzing hand landmarks, the program displays which hand is detected on the screen, enhancing interactive experiences such as gesture-based controls.
